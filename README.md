### Creating a new presentation

Use `bs init` to create a new presentation along with a `template` directory in the current directory. The `template` directory is needed for `backslide` to transform your Markdown files into HTML presentations.

Then edit the file `presentation.md` to get started.

You can create as many markdown presentations as you want in the directory, they will all be based on the same template.

If you want to start a new presentation using your own custom template, you can use `bs init --template <your_template_dir>`.
You can also set the environment variable `BACKSLIDE_TEMPLATE_DIR` to change the default template used by `bs init`.

### Making your slides

Use `bs serve` to start a development server with live reload.
A page will automatically open in your web browser showing all your presentations.

Select one to see the preview, you can then edit your `.md` file and see the changes immediately as you save the file. Any style change will also be applied live.

Slides are written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), along with some useful **Remark.js** specific additions.
See the [Remark.js wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki) for the specific syntax and helpers.

#### Customize style

Just edit the `template/style.scss` file and make changes according to your needs.
The base theme already provides some helpful additions.

The stylesheet is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), but you can use plain CSS instead if you feel like it, as long as you don't change the file extension.

### Exporting your slides

#### As self-contained HTML

Use `bs export` to export all your `.md` files as HTML presentations.

Everything will be inlined in the HTML document (scripts, css, etc) so you don't need a network to show your presentation.
If you have images, it's best to include them as [data-uri](https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/) in your markdown, but local images links are inlined too during export.

If you have set a `title` variable in your document (like this `title: My Awesome Presentation`), it will be used as the HTML document title, otherwise the file name will be used.

> Note: you can strip presenter notes from the exported HTML using the `--strip-notes` option, and remove slide fragments with the `--handouts` option.

#### As a website

Use `bs export --web <file>.md` to export a presentation into a static HTML website.

Files within the `template` folder and from the `assets`, `images` and `img` folders will be copied to the destination folder.

### Converting your slides to PDF

Use `bs pdf` to export your all `.md` files as PDF presentations.

> Note: you can remove slide fragements with the `--handouts` option.

This feature is based on [Decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape/).

For this feature to work, you need to install [Decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape/):

npm install -g decktape
```
